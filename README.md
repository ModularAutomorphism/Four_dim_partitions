# Repository Name: Four_dim_partitions

## What it contains:
This repository contains implementation of Bratley-McKay algorithm for an extremely fast 4-D partitions (i.e. 5-D Ferrers diagram) enumeration. This repository will also contain Monte Carlo codes for asymptotic analysis of 4D partitions once they get ready for publication.

## Licensing:
The codes are authored by Avinandan Mondal, Theoretical Physics Division, Raman Research Institute, Bangalore (change in affiliation will be updated here). The codes are licensed under CC-BY-4.0. In short, it means that the codes are free to use and can be modified but if used for any academic work in the original or modified form, it must cite the original author (Avinandan Mondal).
